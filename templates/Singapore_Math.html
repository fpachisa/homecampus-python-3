	<h1>What is Singapore Math?</h1>
	
	<p class="">
		Singapore Maths is a way of learning and mastering essential mathematical skills and concepts at the <b>elementary (primary)</b> 
		and <b>middle school (secondary)</b> levels with a strong emphasis on problem solving.
	</p>
	<p class="">
		A distinguishing feature of the Singapore primary mathematics curriculum is the use of the <b>Model Method for problem solving</b>.
		The Model Method or Bar Model Method, in use since the 1980s, is a <b>child-friendly pictorial language</b> 
		used to develop students' understanding of fundamental mathematics concepts and proficiency in solving basic math word problems.
	</p>
	<p class="">
		Historically, students have always had difficulty with problem sums in the early years of primary school.
		To address this issue, the Ministry of Education (MOE), the central education authority in Singapore, advocated the 
		<b>Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach</b>. This approach makes use of <b>everyday experiences</b>, <b>learning aids</b> and 
		<b>pictorial representations</b> to help students understand abstract concepts.
	</p>

	<div class="">
		Here are a few simple examples to illustrate the use of the <b>heuristic</b> model method for problem solving:<br>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Example 1 -->
	<div class="explain-example">
		<div class="explain-example__ques">
			214 adults and 258 children visited Singapore Zoo last Thursday. How many people visited the zoo last Thursday?
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__ans">
			<img src="/images/site/Singapore_Maths_Model_Method_Example_1.png" title="Singapore Maths - Model Method Example 1" alt="Singapore Maths - Model Method Example 1" /><br />
			214 + 258 = 472<br>
			472 people visited the zoo last Thursday.<br>
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__side">
			The bar is made of two parts which collectively make a whole. By adding the two parts 
			(the number of adults i.e. 214, and the number of children i.e. 258), students can find the whole 
			(the total number of people, shown by the symbol ?).
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Example 2 -->
	<div class="explain-example">
		<div class="explain-example__ques">
			472 people visited Singapore Zoo last Thursday. If there were 214 adults, how many children were there?
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__ans">
			<img src="/images/site/Singapore_Maths_Model_Method_Example_2.png" title="Singapore Maths - Model Method Example 2" alt="Singapore Maths - Model Method Example 2" /><br />
			472 &minus; 214 = 258<br>
			There were 258 children.
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__side">
			Here the whole (the total number of people) and one part (the number of adults) are given. The other part 
			(the number of children, shown by the symbol ?) can be found by subtracting the given part (214) from the whole (472).
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Example 3 -->
	<div class="explain-example">
		<div class="explain-example__ques">
			There are 5 ostriches at Singapore Zoo. There are 6 times as many flamingos as ostriches at the zoo. How many flamingos are there at the zoo?
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__ans">
			<img src="/images/site/Singapore_Maths_Model_Method_Example_3.png" title="Singapore Maths - Model Method Example 3" alt="Singapore Maths - Model Method Example 3" /><br />
			<table class="FractionsTable">
				<tr><td>1 unit</td><td style="padding-top:8px">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/images/notes/right_arrow.png" />&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:left">5</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6 units</td><td style="padding-top:8px">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="/images/notes/right_arrow.png" />&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:left">6 &times; 5</td></tr>
				<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:right">=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td style="text-align:left">30</td></tr>
			</table>
			
			There are 30 flamingos at the zoo.
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__side">
			The model above is made of two bars of lengths 6 units (the number of flamingos) and 1 unit (the number of ostriches) 
			to show a comparison between the two quantities. The model shows that the number of flamingos is 6 times the number 
			of ostriches. Given the number of ostriches (1 unit = 5), we can find the number of flamingos (6 units) by multiplication.
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<!-- Example 4 -->
	<div class="explain-example">
		<div class="explain-example__ques">
			There are 30 flamingos at Singapore Zoo. There are 6 times as many flamingos as ostriches at the zoo. How many ostriches are there at the zoo?

			</table>
			
			There are 5 ostriches at the zoo.
		</div>
		
		<div class="explain-example__side">

				Singapore school children have consistently been among the top since the 1990s in the Trends in International Mathematics and

			At Home Campus, we believe that <b>everybody can be good at mathematics</b>, as has been proved in Singapore. 
			As such, we follow the <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/syllabuses/sciences/files/maths-primary-2007.pdf" alt="Primary Maths syllabus" title=="Primary Maths syllabus">
			latest curriculum set by MOE</a> in all the modules at Home Campus - 
			<a href="Learn" alt="Watch and Learn" title="Watch and Learn">Learn</a>, 
			<a href="Practice" alt="Practice makes perfect" title="Practice makes perfect">Practice</a> 
			and <a href="Elementary_Mathematics_Worksheets" alt="Assess with unlimited worksheets" title="Assess with unlimited worksheets">
			Worksheets</a>.
		</p>
	
		<p class="">
			<a href="/Learn" alt="Watch and Learn" title="Watch and Learn">Videos and notes</a> 
			in the Learn module of Home Campus extensively use pictorial models like <b>bar models</b>, 
			<b>number bonds</b>, <b>place value charts</b>, etc. to explain each concept. 
			Explanations are mostly just a few words in highlighted boxes making it easy to read and understand the concept.
		</p>
	
		<p class="">
			The <a href="/Practice" alt="Practice makes perfect" title="Practice makes perfect">Practice</a> and 
			<a href="Elementary_Mathematics_Worksheets" alt="Assess with unlimited worksheets" title="Assess with unlimited worksheets">Worksheets</a> modules 
			heavily use everyday <b>real-life examples in problems with solutions</b> explained either pictorially or in a 
			few easy-to-follow steps.
		</p>
		
		<p class="">
			These visuals provide students with a simple yet powerful tool to represent quantities and their relationships given in 
			a problem and then work out strategies to solve the problem. Students learn when to add, subtract, multiply or divide, 
			relying on the meaning of the problem situation rather than relying on clue-words or memorizing rules. Models are also a 
			useful aid to help students understand the concepts of <b>fractions</b>, <b>percentages</b> and <b>ratio</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p class="">
			The various tools at Home Campus allow students to master basic math skills at a more rapid pace. Students begin solving 
			<b>simple multi-step word problems in third grade</b>, using models. Later grades apply this same method to more and more 
			difficult problems. By the end of the <b>sixth grade, students have mastered complex topics</b> and are comfortable doing 
			difficult multi-step word problems that are traditionally solved using Algebra.
		</p>
		
		<p class="">
			As the Singapore maths curriculum becomes popular, more and more educators worldwide recognize its benefits. 
			Home Campus is here to <b>support students and educators</b> adopt the Singapore way of learning and teaching math.
